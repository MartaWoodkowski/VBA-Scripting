# VBA

## Steps

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* The result should look as follows.


### Final touch

1. Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

2. Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

### Some Considerations

* Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.

* Make sure you save your workbook as a macro enabled workbook (.xlsm), or you VBA code may be lost.

* You can assume that entries for any given ticker are in consecutive rows and that the entries are in chronological order.
